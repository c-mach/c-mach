# 👋 Hello! I'm Carman (she/they)

## ✨ A Front-End Web Developer, former chef, full-time snacker, avid gamer and proud dog-parent 🐕
 
I recently pivoted careers from being in the hospitality industry as an operations chef and became a front-end web developer. The pandemic allowed me to explore other creative outputs where I discovered the parallels of coding and cooking. Fuelled by my curiosity and probably way too many espressos; I found my passion for coding and bringing ideas to life by creating fun, responsive, and accessible apps! As a recent graduate of Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp, I am excited to make an impact as a developer by typpity-typing one line of code at a time!
