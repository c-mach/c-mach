# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Carman (she/they)

## A Front-End Web Developer, former chef, full-time snacker, gamer and proud dog-parent

I recently pivoted careers from being a chef in the hospitality industry working in operations and management and into front-end web development. The pandemic gave me the opportunity to explore other creative outputs which grew my love for coding further as I love bringing ideas to life by creating fun, responsive, and accessible apps! As a recent graduate of Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp, I am excited to navigate through my tech journey by writing impactful code one line at a time!
