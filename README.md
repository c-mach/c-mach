# Hello! 👋 I'm Carman (she/they)

## A Front-End Web Developer, former chef, full-time snacker, gamer and proud dog-parent
 
I recently pivoted careers from being in the hospitality industry as an operations chef and into a front-end web developer. The pandemic gave me the opportunity to explore other creative outputs which grew my love for coding further as I love bringing ideas to life by creating fun, responsive, and accessible apps! As a recent graduate of Juno College's Web Development Immersive Bootcamp, I am excited to make an impact as a developer by typpity-typing one line of code at a time!
